# SVFA (Sparse Value Flow Analysis) implementation based on Soot

This is a scala implementation of a framework that builds a sparse-value flow graph using Soot.

## Status

   * Experimental.

## Usage

   * Clone this repository or download a stable release.
   * Add a GitHub token to your **~/.gitconfig**.
     ```
     [github]
             token = TOKEN
     ```
   * Build this project using sbt (`sbt compile test`)
   * Publish the artifact as a JAR file in your m2 repository (`sbt publish`)
   * Create a dependency to the svfa-scala artifact in your maven project. 

```{xml}
<dependency>	
  <groupId>br.unb.cic</groupId>
  <artifactId>svfa-scala_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>
```

   * Implement a class that extends the `JSVFA class` (see some examples in the scala tests). you must provide implementations to the following methods.
      * `getEntryPoints()` to set up the "main" methods. This implementation must return a list of Soot methods.
      * `sootClassPath()` to set up the soot classpath. This implementation must return a string.
      * `analyze(unit)` to identify the type of a node  (source, sink, simple node) in the graph; given a statement (soot unit).

## Installation

- Install Scala Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Install Java 8 (Java JDK Path `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`).
```{bash}
  sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
  sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```
- Clone the project:
```{bash}
    git clone https://github.com/rbonifacio/svfa-scala
```
- Add GitHub token in `~/.gitconfig`.
- IDE
  - Reload `sbt` .
  - Set Project's settings to work with Java 8.
  - Build Project.
  - Run test.


## Benchmark

This project integrates 2 well-known benchmarks.

### Securibench

This benchmark was integrated because it is also used in the [FlowDroid Project](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid) and tests cases are in `src/test/java/securibench`.

**OBSERVATIONS**
- Flowdroid is not taking in count the TP expected in StrongUpdate4;
- Test Basic40 is commented in the test suite so the amount of TP differs from the original run by Flowdroid;

### Taintbench: (WIP) 

[Taintbench](https://github.com/TaintBench/TaintBench/releases/download/TaintBenchSuite/TaintBench.zip) contains a set o Android Apks that are old malware apps.
We have created a file `taintbench.properties` in `src/test/resources` to set the configurations.
